        I tried performing this on the weblab servers. After some research it
        seems that this is not supported by the server.  More info was found online at
        "http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html" under the section 501.-->
    <!--When uploaded to github a similar error was found. "[HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden 31ms]"
        Made it easier on myself and used Curran's Code, it worked after.-->
