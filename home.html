  My name is Eduardo and I welcome you to my homepage. Here you will find information
  about myself, projects I am working on, and my contact information. This page
  was constructed to be a single page to reduce redundancy in code. It does not
  implement a cache system yet but will soon. If you have any feedback about this
  page your comments are welcomed using my contact information.
