         "Dedication and passion alone is not enough for you to find a job or keep it, hard work is needed as well.",
         "The sport of rock climbing is no different, the freedom you feel as you defy gravity and test your limits is enough to inspire a love for a sport that requires dedication and hard work to advance in."

         "I've only climbed for a little over a year now but it only took me one day to get hooked.",
         "As I ascended my first indoor rock wall I felt a rush of excitement that can only be described as liberating.",
         "As I tried more routes I found myself escaping the pressures of life, and running into a calm mindset that everything in the world is alright.",
         "Now, over a year later I still get the same feeling of liberation that I now rely on to get through my week.",
         "My performance does not get graded or judged by anyone but myself leaving me feeling free."

         "When I climb I always reach mental barriers and thoughts of doubt of whether or not I can finish a route.",
         "When you're anywhere from 40' to 200' above the ground it's understandable to let doubt settle in.",
         "Though with my own courage, and the occasional inspirational words from friends, I push through these barriers and find myself in a mental state that is often hard to achieve.",
         "A state of confidence.",
         "That's why I climb, it's one of the only situations I feel confident and it's a feeling that is simply intoxicating"
