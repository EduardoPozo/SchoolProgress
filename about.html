<h1>About Me</h1>
<!--This page will just contain information about myself and may be updated-->
<p>
  My name is Eduardo Pozo and I am a Computer Science student at UMass Lowell.  I have earned my Associates Degree
  in C.S. at Middlesex Community College and anticipating to Graduate in the
  the Fall of 2015 with my Bachelors Degree from UMass Lowell.  Most of my knowledge
  has come from my school curriculum but I have recently been learning Android application
  programming with hopes to release an application to the market. Outside of school I 
  regularly take part in activities away from the keyboard.  I enjoy rock/ice climbing,
  snowboarding, and hiking in the White Mountains. I hope to travel in the near future
  to different parts of the world and experience what sights the world has to offer.
